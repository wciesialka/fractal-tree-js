# fractal-tree-js
Fractal Tree generator using JS and HTML5.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Currently there are plans to move this to a website of my own, with some neat styling. However, as it stands this can be run with several local hosting programs. Personally I used node.js with the `connect` and `serve-static` packages.

### Using

Simply move the sliders around or change the numbers directly to your desired inputs and press
grow to watch the tree grow iteration by iteration.
